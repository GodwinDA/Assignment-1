EIP-712 is a standardized method for structuring and signing human-readable and machine-verifiable data. This method allows users to understand the content they're signing. 

### key concepts of the EIP 777
Typed Data: EIP-712 introduces the concept of "typed data," which is structured data that includes type information, making it both human-readable and machine-verifiable. Typed data can consist of various data types like strings, integers, addresses, and arrays.

Domain Separator: This unique identifier distinguishes different applications or services, preventing potential signature replay attacks across multiple applications.

Structured Signing: EIP-712 enforces a standardized way of signing typed data, which ensures that users know exactly what they're signing and provides a consistent signing experience across different Ethereum applications.

### How EIP-712 Works

EIP-712 achieves its goals by introducing a method for creating a unique hash of the typed data that the user signs. The process consists of the following steps:

Define the data structure: Developers define the data structure with type information using a JSON schema, which includes the data types and their respective names.

Encode the typed data: The typed data is encoded according to the EIP-712 specification. This process involves generating a unique hash of the data structure, the domain separator, and the actual data.

Sign the hash: Users sign the resulting hash with their private key through a web3 wallet like MetaMask or another signing tool.

 The structured signing process ensures that users know exactly what they're signing, making it difficult for attackers to trick users into signing malicious data.
Verify the signature: The receiving party, typically a smart contract or a backend service, can verify the signature using the signer's public key and the original typed data.
